# CPPProject_starter
A script that when ran makes the folders src, includes and objects, a makefile and a generic cpp main file in the current directory.

All you gotta do is run the script in the directory you want with the executable name you prefer (./makeProject.sh projectName)

PS: You might have to give the file permission to be executed (chmod u+x makeProject.sh)
